# Web Interface Guidelines

## Usage Contract

**Task type:** Apply the domain guidance below to the caller's active task; this skill is a reference, not an independent workflow.

**Required input:** A concrete question, design, file, diff, or implementation decision within this skill's domain.

**Do:**
- Select only the relevant rules, reconcile them with repository-specific instructions, and cite concrete evidence when evaluating existing work.
- State assumptions and applicability limits when the available context is incomplete.

**Don't:**
- Do not invent repository facts, tool results, versions, or requirements.
- Do not apply examples mechanically when the project's source of truth conflicts with them.

**Completion:** Return actionable guidance or a checked result in the caller's requested format; identify any unresolved evidence gap explicitly.

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Fetch the latest guidelines from the source URL below
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Fetch fresh guidelines before each review:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md
```

Use WebFetch to retrieve the latest rules. The fetched content contains all the rules and output format instructions.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Fetch guidelines from the source URL above
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
