# Prompt Review (Iterative Improvement Loop)

## Usage Contract

**Task type:** Apply the domain guidance below to the caller's active task; this skill is a reference, not an independent workflow.

**Required input:** A concrete question, design, file, diff, or implementation decision within this skill's domain.

**Do:**
- Select only the relevant rules, reconcile them with repository-specific instructions, and cite concrete evidence when evaluating existing work.
- State assumptions and applicability limits when the available context is incomplete.

**Don't:**
- Do not invent repository facts, tool results, versions, or requirements.
- Do not apply examples mechanically when the project's source of truth conflicts with them.

**Completion:** Return actionable guidance or a checked result in the caller's requested format; identify any unresolved evidence gap explicitly.

Orchestrates a continuous improve-evaluate cycle until the prompt meets quality standards.

```

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Load Reference

Load `omb-prompt-guide` to have the full rule set available for remediation guidance.

### Step 2: Initial Evaluation

Run `omb-prompt-evaluation` on the input prompt. This produces:
- **Score sheet** — Evidence-anchored pass/fail across 57 items, 11 dimensions
- **Issue tickets** — P0-P3 prioritized with quoted evidence and remediation

### Step 3: Diagnose Root Causes

Before fixing individual issues, cluster related failures by root cause. Multiple FAIL items often share a single underlying problem. Fixing the root cause resolves multiple items at once.

**Root Cause Categories:**

| Category | Signal | Fix Approach |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **STRUCTURAL** | Multiple structure.* and separation failures | Add XML tag structure: `<role>`, `<task>`, `<rules>`, `<format>`. Reorder components per 10-component framework. |
| **UNDERSPECIFIED** | Multiple clarity.* and output.* failures | Replace each vague qualifier with a concrete number. Add explicit format specification with schema. Add 2-3 input-output examples. |
| **MISSING-COMPONENT** | Entire dimension scores 0% | Add the missing component entirely: role section, examples block, safety rules, verification step. |
| **OVERENGINEERED** | safety.calibrated FAIL + clarity.no-conflicts; OR 5+ stacked CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER directives; OR native-4.7-scaffolding present | Prune excessive directives. Remove scaffolding 4.7 handles natively. Add subagent guidance if missing. Resolve contradictions. |
| **MODE-CONFUSION** | Mixed Build+Learn+Critique lexical markers simultaneously + clarity.task-objective FAIL + clarity.no-conflicts FAIL (and NOT matching OVERENGINEERED) | Identify the dominant mode. Remove conflicting-mode language. Rewrite for a single declared mode. |
| **CONTEXT-MISMATCH** | claude-code.* or tool.* failures on wrong prompt type | Reframe for the correct use case (agent vs chat, Claude Code vs API, single-turn vs multi-window). |

**Diagnosis output format:**

```
Root Cause Analysis:
1. STRUCTURAL — No XML tags → affects structure.xml-tags, structure.separation, structure.ordering
2. UNDERSPECIFIED — Vague constraints → affects clarity.specificity, output.length-specified
3. MISSING-COMPONENT — No examples → affects examples.present, examples.format-demo, examples.good-bad
```

### Step 4: Improvement Loop

For each iteration (max 3):

1. **Plan fixes by root cause** — One fix per root cause, not per item
2. **Apply fixes** using the Fix Strategy Templates (below):
   - Reference the specific `omb-prompt-guide` rule for each fix
   - Apply the remediation from the issue ticket
   - Preserve all existing good qualities (do not regress)
3. **Re-evaluate** — Run `omb-prompt-evaluation` on the improved prompt
4. **Regression check** — Produce a diff table:

```
| Item ID | Before | After | Delta |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| clarity.task-objective | FAIL | PASS | +1 |
| structure.xml-tags | PASS | PASS | 0 |
| examples.present | PASS | FAIL | -1 REGRESSION |
```

**Any REGRESSION (-1) entries must be fixed before proceeding.** If a fix introduces a regression, the fix is wrong — revise it.

5. **Check exit condition**:
   - **Exit if:** 0 P0 AND 0 P1 remaining → proceed to final report
   - **Continue if:** P0 or P1 issues remain AND iterations < 3
   - **Force exit if:** iterations = 3 → report with remaining issues
   - **Plateau exit** (see below)

## Fix Strategy Templates

For each root cause category, apply the corresponding template:

### STRUCTURAL fixes
1. Wrap content types in XML tags: `<role>`, `<task>`, `<rules>`, `<examples>`, `<format>`
2. Reorder components per 10-component framework (role → context → task → rules → examples → format)
3. Nest hierarchical content with parent-child tags (`<examples><example>`)

### UNDERSPECIFIED fixes
1. Replace each vague qualifier with a concrete number ("short" → "max 3 sentences")
2. Add 2-3 input-output examples in `<examples>` tags
3. Add explicit format specification with schema or template

### MISSING-COMPONENT fixes
1. Add the missing section using the minimal template from `omb-prompt-guide`
2. Place it in the correct position per the 10-component framework
3. Keep it minimal — add just enough to pass the relevant checklist items

### OVERENGINEERED fixes

This template fires when ANY of the following sub-signals is present (all three are 4.7 additions):

**Sub-signal A — Aggressive CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER stacking** (merges former OVER-TRIGGERING per R1)
- Signal: 5+ CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER directives across the prompt.
- Fix:
  1. Count CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER instances — reduce to 2-3 targeted rules.
  2. Replace emphasis caps with specific behavioral instructions.
  3. Consolidate overlapping safety directives into one rule.

**Sub-signal B — Missing explicit subagent guidance under 4.7 defaults**
- Signal: Prompt targets a Claude 4.7 agent context but omits explicit subagent spawning / tool-call budget guidance (e.g., no `<use_parallel_tool_calls>`, no mention of subagent limits).
- Fix:
  1. Add explicit subagent-count or tool-call-budget instruction per `omb-prompt-guide` rule `claude-4-7-subagent-tuning.md`.
  2. Specify whether parallel tool calls are intended (include canonical `<use_parallel_tool_calls>` XML if so).

**Sub-signal C — Non-removed scaffolding that 4.7 handles natively**
- Signal: Prompt includes explicit instructions for behaviors 4.7 performs automatically (e.g., "summarize every 3 tool calls", "always restate the task before answering", manual progress-update cadence).
- Fix:
  1. Remove instructions that duplicate 4.7 built-in behaviors (progress updates, adaptive thinking, direct tone).
  2. Reference `claude-4-7-user-facing-updates.md` for the canonical list of natively-handled behaviors.

**Evidence section requirement:** When OVERENGINEERED fires, the ticket's Evidence field MUST list all rubric items that would have fired individually (to prevent coverage loss per de-dup matrix). Individual item tickets for those same items are suppressed.

**Unified fix direction:**
1. Count CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER instances — reduce to 2-3 targeted rules.
2. Identify and resolve contradictory instructions.
3. Remove redundant safety language that doesn't add new constraints.
4. Add explicit subagent guidance if Sub-signal B triggered (per `claude-4-7-subagent-tuning.md`).
5. Strip native-4.7 scaffolding if Sub-signal C triggered (per `claude-4-7-user-facing-updates.md`).

### CONTEXT-MISMATCH fixes
1. Identify the actual use case (agent, chat, Claude Code, API)
2. Add/remove dimensions based on the N/A Decision Tree
3. Reframe instructions for the correct context (e.g., add verification for agents)

### MODE-CONFUSION fixes

This template fires ONLY when ALL THREE conditions are simultaneously true:

1. **Mixed-mode language fingerprints** — The prompt contains lexical markers from two or more mutually exclusive modes:
   - Build markers: "implement", "create", "build", "write code", "produce output"
   - Learn markers: "explain", "teach", "describe", "what is", "how does"
   - Critique markers: "review", "evaluate", "assess", "judge", "rate", "critique"
2. **FAIL on `clarity.task-objective` AND `clarity.no-conflicts`** — Both of these rubric items score FAIL in the evaluation.
3. **NOT matching OVERENGINEERED** — Aggressive CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER stacking (Sub-signal A) is NOT the dominant signal. If caps stacking is present alongside mode mixing, OVERENGINEERED takes precedence (see De-duplication Matrix below).

**Fix steps:**
1. Identify which mode is the primary intent (Build, Debug, Rewrite, or Learn).
2. Remove all lexical markers from other modes; rewrite those sections in the primary mode's language.
3. Declare the mode explicitly at the prompt opening (per `modes-four-modes.md`).
4. Verify `clarity.task-objective` and `clarity.no-conflicts` now pass.

**Evidence section requirement:** When MODE-CONFUSION fires, the ticket's Evidence field MUST quote the mixed-mode language fragments and list all suppressed item-level tickets (at minimum `clarity.task-objective` and `clarity.no-conflicts`).

## De-duplication Matrix & Template Precedence

When the same underlying defect produces signals at multiple layers (rubric item + root-cause template), this matrix defines clustering behavior to prevent double-counting. See `omb-prompt-evaluation/SKILL.md` for the rubric-side counterpart.

### Precedence Order

```
OVERENGINEERED > MODE-CONFUSION > item-level tickets
```

- If OVERENGINEERED matches, it supersedes MODE-CONFUSION and suppresses individual item tickets for the same defect.
- If MODE-CONFUSION matches (and OVERENGINEERED does NOT), it suppresses individual item tickets for the same defect.
- Item-level tickets are issued only when no template matches the defect.

### Suppression Rule

When a template fires, its ticket's Evidence section MUST list all rubric items that would have been raised as individual tickets. This ensures no coverage loss: the items are visible in the template ticket even though standalone tickets are not generated.

### Template Matrix

| Underlying defect | Rubric items that may FAIL | Template | Precedence |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------|------------|
| Aggressive caps stacking ("CRITICAL: You MUST" across 5+ directives) | `safety.no-aggressive-caps-stacking` + possibly `safety.calibrated` + `tool.action-mode` | OVERENGINEERED (Sub-signal A) | Highest — suppresses MODE-CONFUSION and item tickets |
| Missing subagent guidance under 4.7 | `tool.subagent-guidance-explicit-for-4-7` + possibly `tool.action-mode` | OVERENGINEERED (Sub-signal B) | Highest |
| Non-removed native-4.7 scaffolding | `safety.calibrated` | OVERENGINEERED (Sub-signal C) | Highest |
| Mode mixing (Build + Learn + Critique simultaneously) | `clarity.task-objective` + `clarity.no-conflicts` + possibly `examples.present` | MODE-CONFUSION | Middle — suppresses item tickets; loses to OVERENGINEERED |
| Missing effort specification | `reasoning.effort-level-specified` | None (item-level only) | Lowest |
| Prefill dependency | `output.no-prefill-dependency` | None (item-level only) | Lowest |
| Instruction repetition | `safety.no-instruction-repetition` | None (item-level only) | Lowest |

### Conflict Resolution Example

A prompt that has BOTH mode mixing AND aggressive caps stacking:
- OVERENGINEERED fires (caps stacking is present — Sub-signal A satisfied).
- MODE-CONFUSION is suppressed (OVERENGINEERED has priority).
- OVERENGINEERED ticket's Evidence lists: `safety.no-aggressive-caps-stacking`, `clarity.task-objective`, `clarity.no-conflicts` (all suppressed items).

See fixture `fixture-both-symptoms.md` for a concrete example.

### Step 4: Final Report

```
## Prompt Review — Final Report

### Iteration Summary

| Iteration | Score | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | Changes Made |
|-----------|-------|----|----|----|----|--------------| 
| Initial   | XX%   | X  | X  | X  | X  | —            |
| Round 1   | XX%   | X  | X  | X  | X  | [summary]    |
| Round 2   | XX%   | X  | X  | X  | X  | [summary]    |
| Final     | XX%   | X  | X  | X  | X  | [summary]    |

### Issue Resolution Log

| Ticket | Priority | Status | Resolution |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| PP-P0-001 | P0 | RESOLVED (R1) | [what was fixed] |
| PP-P1-001 | P1 | RESOLVED (R2) | [what was fixed] |
| PP-P2-001 | P2 | OPEN | [deferred — not blocking] |
| PP-P3-001 | P3 | OPEN | [optional improvement] |

### Remaining Issues (P2/P3 — non-blocking)

[List any P2/P3 issues that were not addressed, with remediation hints]

### Final Prompt

[The fully improved prompt after all iterations]

### Verdict

- **PASS** — 0 P0, 0 P1, overall score ≥80%
- **CONDITIONAL PASS** — 0 P0, 0 P1, overall score 65-79%
- **FAIL** — P0 or P1 issues remain after 3 iterations
```

## Exit Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 0 P0 + 0 P1 + score ≥80% | **PASS** — output final prompt |
| 0 P0 + 0 P1 + score 65-79% | **CONDITIONAL PASS** — output with P2/P3 notes |
| P0 or P1 remain after 3 iterations | **FAIL** — output best version + unresolved tickets |
| **Score plateau** | **PLATEAU** — stop early (see criteria below) |

### Plateau Detection (improved)

Stop early when improvement has stalled. Three plateau signals:

| Signal | Criterion | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Score plateau** | Overall score improves <3% AND no P0/P1 issues resolved in this iteration | Stop — diminishing returns |
| **Issue plateau** | Same P0/P1 issues remain open after fix attempt (fix didn't work) | Stop — root cause needs user input |
| **Oscillation** | An issue resolved in round N reappears as FAIL in round N+1 | Stop — fix is introducing regressions |

When a plateau is detected, report which signal triggered it and suggest what the user should consider.

## Rules

- **Do not regress** — Each iteration must preserve all previously passing items. Produce the regression diff table to verify.
- **Diagnose before fixing** — Cluster failures by root cause before applying fixes. One root cause fix > five item-level fixes.
- **P0 before P1** — Always fix critical issues first
- **P2/P3 are optional** — Only fix P2/P3 if P0/P1 are already resolved and iterations remain
- **Show your work** — Each fix must reference the guide rule AND the root cause category it addresses
- **Minimal changes** — Fix the issue without rewriting unaffected sections
- **Evidence in tickets** — Every issue ticket must include the quoted evidence from the evaluation
- **Ticket format** — See `.Codex/rules/workflow/09-ticket-schema.md` for canonical schema. Use `PP-P{N}-{NNN}` prefix for all tickets.
